# ghost-rodeo
A less threatening and cuter version of whack-a-mole.

Rodeo Ghost is an exciting and wholesome twist on Whack-a-Mole.

As a bronco caretaker, your job is to take care of as many horses as possible by petting them on the head. 

But, beware of the skeleton horse, who can make you lose points!

Theme: Cliché
This year's theme is cliché, in which I decided to take a twist on the phrase: "Beat a dead horse." 

While the phrase taken literally is a little macabre, Ghost Rodeo spins the cliché on its head, and turns it into a wholesome story. The cliche crafted the main mechanism of the gameplay: pet as many horses as possible, and avoid the skeleton horse (ie, don't beat a dead horse).



Ghost Rodeo is made for the Github Game Off 2022.
